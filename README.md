# Apollo TEMP-1



Key Features of the TEMP-1 Sensor:

External 1m Temperature Probe: The TEMP-1 comes with a 1m waterproof temperature probe. This allows you to measure temperature in hard-to-reach places or in areas where the sensor itself cannot be placed.

Onboard Temperature/Humidity Sensor: The TEMP-1 also has an onboard temperature sensor, which can be used to measure ambient temperature and humidity.

Battery Powered: The TEMP-1 is powered by a 600mAh rechargeable battery, which can last up to x weeks on a single charge. The battery can be recharged via USB-C.


Dimensions & Design: 

The TEMP-1 measures just xmm x xmm x x0mm, and we have focused on efficient heat management within this small package to maintain sensor accuracy. This includes a thoughtful PCB layout and case design, incorporating ventilation and strategic component placement.
